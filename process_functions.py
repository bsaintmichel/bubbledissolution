I consider :
* a neo-Hookean elastic medium, with ${\bf T} = -p {\bf I} + G {\bf B}$ under yielding, and a purely plastic medium above it 
* a yielding criterion that is von Mises, as used in Venerus 2015 
* a yielded region of size $S$, as defined by Venerus 2015 at Equation (20).
* plastic stresses above yielding in the form of $2 \sqrt{3} \sigma_Y \ln (R/S)$ with $S$ the size of the yielded region (Eq. 22 from Venerus 2015)
* a surface tension that is constant with the bubble radius $R(t)$, i.e. no surfactants or anything
