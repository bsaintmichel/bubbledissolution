    "## Bubble dissolution _à la_ Venerus JNNFM 2015\n",

    "\n",
    "Considering the values of $N_{\\rm p}$ and $N_{\\rm a}$, I have completely omitted viscous contributions to the stress in Equation (22) of the 2015 JNNFM paper of Venerus. They will be small anyway maybe except very close to bubble dissolution, which will only affect the last experimental data points of the dissolution profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have first computed, for this value of $N_{\\sigma}$, a function that yields the extent $S$ of the yielded region as a function of $R$ and $R_0$. This can be done (badly) by computing this extent $S$ for plenty of values of $R/R_0 = \\epsilon$ [numerically solving Equation (20) from the paper] and creating an 'interpolating function' to produce values of $S$ for any $\\epsilon$. This is not too problematic since $S$ is not really singular for any $\\epsilon$ and tends to a well-defined constant value for $R \\to 0$ and to a value proportional to $R$ for $\\epsilon \\to \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to compute the elastic and plastic contributions to the bubble pressure [from Equation (22)] for any given $\\epsilon = R/R_0$. Since both terms involve $S$, I have also created interpolating functions to compute them for any $\\epsilon$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Summing these two contributions and adding the Laplace term give the total extra pressure in the bubble compared to far away from it, $p(R) - p_0$. "

    "We do recover here the $S/R_0 \\to 2.25$ of Fig.3 (right) of Venerus JNNFM 2015 (with the x axis flipped), which is quite reassuring. Considering values of $N_\\sigma$ above $0.1$ seems a bit odd to me, since most yield-stress fluids are more _fragile_ than Carbopol. Reasonable limits for such a value should be between $0$ and $0.2$. The range of radii for which the matrix is unyielded is very small, and only spans from $R/R_0 =  0.97$ to $R/R_0 = 1.03$.\n",
